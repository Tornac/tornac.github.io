        <p>
            This site serves as a landing page for some sample web apps I've created in the past. The apps are generally
            fairly simple and were created as a learning experience and not originally intended to be published
            anywhere.

            <p>
                An application allowing the user to manage a todo-list, allowing the creation of new elements as well as
                their deletion.
                Entries in the todo-list can be marked as completed and they are stored on the device they are created
                on.
                This project uses React and Typescript.

                Created as a joke, referencing a common phrase in a video game. Features some very simple CSS
